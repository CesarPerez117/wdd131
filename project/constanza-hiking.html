        Towering at 3,101 meters (10,174 ft), Pico Duarte is the highest mountain in the Caribbean. The most popular route begins in La Ciénaga near Jarabacoa and takes 2–3 days to complete. Hikers pass through pine forests, rivers, and high-altitude valleys like La Compartición before reaching the summit. A guide and park permit are required, and mules are often used to carry gear. Sunrise at the summit is a must-see moment of national pride.
